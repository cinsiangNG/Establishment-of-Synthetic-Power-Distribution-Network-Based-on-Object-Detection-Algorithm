# Establishment-of-Synthetic-Power-Distribution-Network-Based-on-Object-Detection-Algorithm
- Utilized street view images to detect poles with a YOLO11x model, developed a self-adaptive constraints Line of Bearing (LOB) positioning method, incorporating grid division to enhance accuracy and efficiency.
- Develops an automated system to download satellite images for any area at fixed intervals, detect poles using a YOLO11 model, and convert detections into geographic coordinates.
- Fusing aerial and street view detections with DBSCAN for map integration.
